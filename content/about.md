**About**
***

Hi, I'm Sharath Patali. For the last 10 years I have been building software systems and frameworks for multi-touch hardware and other mediums. Professionally I also work with android and web technologies. This is my personal website where I will be posting about my experiments, code and other things that I find fascinating.

I consider myself a perpetual student of computer science and engineering. I'm curious by nature so I love tinkering and breaking things. What better way to learn things than trying to fix the thing that was not supposed to be broken. As a hobby I also like a bit of basic electronics, photography and sketching.
