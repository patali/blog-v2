Hi, I'm Sharath Patali. For the last 15 years, I've focused on creating software systems and frameworks for multi-touch hardware, mobile technologies, distributed systems, and other tech that genuinely fascinates me. Also got an invaluable opportunity to help build a company from it's early startup phase all the way through to its acquistion. Welcome to my personal website, where I'll share my experiments, code, and anything else I find fun.

I'm a perpetual student in the world of computer science and engineering. I love to tinker and break things â€“ and what better way to truly learn than by fixing what wasn't supposed to be broken in the first place? Outside of tech, my hobbies include basic electronics, photography, 3D printing, painting, and sketching.
